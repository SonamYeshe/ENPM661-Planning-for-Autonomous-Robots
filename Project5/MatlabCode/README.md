## FinalFor661
This is a implementation of coverage path planning algorithm.

## Dependencies
1. Matlab

## Run
1. Run Main.m first to generate the working space.
2. Run CPP.m to generate the path and the results will be shown in the figure 1 which is generated in the step 1.
3. Run resampledPathPlot.m to see a more clear result by preserve only 1 node from 15.

## Algorithm
1. Morse decomposition to find critical points and segment cells.
2. Depth-search algorithm to find inter-cell exhaustive walk.
3. Boustrophedon motion to cover every cell.
